# Makefile

The Makefile contains alias for basic commands, these commands need .env files generated before

- `make start-local` to start the cluster locally
- `make start-local service=nginx` to restart a specific service (in this example nginx)
- `make start` to start the cluster in dev server
- `make start service=nginx` to restart a specific service (in this example nginx)
- `make destroy` to remove volumes

# Local development

To run the cluster, on local environment:

1. run `sudo ./add-local-hosts
` to add containers domain name to your /etc/hosts
2. generate ssl self-signed certificates with `./gen-local-certs`
3. If the output from the previous command tells you so, install the `myCA.pem` certificate into your system's certificate store
4. run `make start-local` to start the cluster
5. open keycloak interface and add a new user
